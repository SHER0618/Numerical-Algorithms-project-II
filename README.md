# Numerical-Algorithms-project-II
FuDan University DATA130002h.01 Numerical Algorithms with Case Studies I final-term project

The main content of this project is low rank image decontamination, the main purpose is to divide a matrix into a low rank matrix and a sparse matrix, using three different optimization methods to deal with six pairs of images, and then compare the results
